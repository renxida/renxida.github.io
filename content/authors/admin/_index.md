I am Cedar Ren. I write kernels and other systems code for high-performance LLM acceleration ASICs.

My interests include systems, hierarchies of abstraction, and various representations for encoding understandings of systems.

I'm interested in learning more about AI governance and AI-related policy. I think hardware security features like the Intel Management Engine, Trusted Platform Modules, and TDX (trusted domain extensions) can be potentially used to support AI governance and I'm happy to talk about how.

I feel at home with people who like words, numbers, and diagrams.
