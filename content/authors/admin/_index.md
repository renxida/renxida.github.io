I am Cedar Ren. I write kernels, compiler, simulation, and other systems code for high-performance LLM acceleration ASICs.

I'm interested in systems, hierarchies of abstraction, and representations of knowledge.

I feel at home with people who like words, numbers, and diagrams.

See my work:
- compiler / LLM serving work at AMD: [github here](https://github.com/nod-ai/shark-ai/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Arenxida)
- x86 hardware security: [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v3MIOTkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra#d=gs_hdr_drw&t=1753917064342)
